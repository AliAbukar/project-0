                                One of the most common security risks in relation to computerized information systems is the 
                                danger of unauthorized access to confidential data .The main concern comes from unwanted intrude
                                rs, or hackers, who use the latest technology and their skills to break into supposedly secure computer
                                s or to disable them .A person who gains access to information system for malicious reason is often terme
                                d of cracker rather than a hacker.

                                Computer virus is a kind of nasty software written deliberately to ent

                                 duplicate itself ,thus continuing to spread .Some viruses do little but duplicate
                                  others can cause severe harm or adversely affect program and performance of the system .Virus program may
                                   still cause crashes and data loss .In many cases ,the damages caused by computer virus might be accidental ,
                                   arising merely as the result of poor programming
                                 .Type of viruses ,for example ,worms and Trojan horses .
