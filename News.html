                <p class="p1"><b style="font-size:50px;">W</b>hat is technology? We spend a lot of time talking about it,
                    but the answer is both easy and surprisingly difficult to locate.
                    Merriam-Webster says technology is:
                    “Application of knowledge to the practical aims of human life or to changing and manipulating the
                     human environment. Technology includes 
                    the use of materials, tools, techniques, and sources of power to make life easier or more pleasant 
                    and work more productive. Whereas science is concerned with how and why things happen, technology 
                    focuses on making things happen.”
                    That’s a tidy definition, but there is nothing in it that could not also be construed to apply to
                     the world of mining, for instance.
                    The word technology is a combination of two Greek words, techne and logos. Techne means art, craft, 
                    or skill. Logos means “to speak of”. Some have since taken the word logos to imply the practical 
                    application of techne, but others say that is stretching its etymological roots.</p>

                 <div class="child"><p>Perhaps the best way to look at technology is in terms of progress. In many ways,
                      the world simply gets better because technology has the ability to create a higher standard of living. 
                      A vaccine eliminated polio. The internet breaks down social, racial and sexual barriers. Computers provide 
                      better access to education. 
                     But is it always true that more technology is the answer to the world’s problems? </p>
                </div>
                </p>
                <p class="p2">
                        Not according to tech legend Bill Gates. Gates say that while the dream of providing internet
                        access to the billions of people who do not have it is a noble one, is isn’t even close to being
                        as important as ensuring that more people have proper plumbing, or access to vaccinations against infectious diseases.

                        “Innovation is a good thing,” Gates told The Financial Times recently.
                         “The human condition – put aside bioterrorism and a few footnotes – is improving because of innovation,” 
                         he says. But while ­“technology’s amazing, it doesn’t get down to the people most in 
                        need in anything near the timeframe we should want it to”.
